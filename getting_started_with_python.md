# Getting started with Python

Depending on you current level of Python I will try to give you piece of advice 
related to learning Python. You can find here recommended books and internet
resources which correspond to your programming experience.


## Beginner
If Python is your first programming language or you don't know how loops 
work this section for you.

You can ask me _Which version of Python to learn `Python2` or `Python3`?_
Unfortunately both :-) but I recommend you to start with `Python 3.5` in case you do
not have projects/work requirements for `Python2`. Then you should review
breaking changes between versions.
