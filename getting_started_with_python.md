# Getting started with Python

Depending on you current level of Python I will try to give you piece of advice
related to learning Python. You can find recommended books and internet
resources which correspond to your programming experience bellow.

This literature contains a lot of code examples. **Please, do not be lazy and
just copy/paste everything from source code examples and rename a few things
but code out each bit yourself. For example, place book examples on the left
side of your screen and place your text editor or IDE on the right side. Then
line by line retype most complex and interesting examples from books and sites.
The goal here is repetition, which will build up memory so that you learn how
to do these things on your own without googling.**

## Beginner
If Python is your first programming language or you don't know how loops
work this section for you.

You can ask me _Which version of Python to learn `Python2` or `Python3`?_
Unfortunately both :-) but I recommend you to start with `Python 3.5` in case
you do not have projects/work requirements for `Python2`. Then you should
review breaking changes between versions.

 - Learn Python the Hard Way - Zed Shaw [`Python2`][b1]
 - Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist - Allen B. Downey [`Python3`][b2]

## Novice
After you get familiar with basic data types and language constructions it is
time for performing useful and interesting small tasks. The best way to learn
new language is to have a lot of practice and follow best practices. It can be
done with help of following awesome site: https://www.codewars.com/ This site
contains a lot of tricky tasks created by experienced programmers grouped by
complexity. Not to mention the fact, that you can check your solution using
prepared tests. Also some the most popular solutions
might use bad practices but this happen mostly for new tasks and quite rare.
Furthermore, if your correct solution does not pass tests check `issue` link,
some tasks might have incorrect tests.

Moreover, from this point we have to dive in Python standard library and Python
topics such as iterators, decorators, properties and so forth. Here are books
which are worth a look:

 - Python Essential Reference, 4th - David Beazley `Python2`
 - The Python Standard Library by Example - Doug Hellmann [`Python2`][n1]/[`Python3`][n2]

## Competent
 - Fluent Python, 1st - Luciano Ramalho `Python3`
 - Python Cookbook, 3rd - David Beazley `Python3`

## Proficient
 - CPython internals - Philip Guo [`Python2`][p1]
